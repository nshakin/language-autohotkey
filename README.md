The easiest way to install it is to install [nshakin's package](https://atom.io/packages/language-autohotkey), and replace `package.json` and `grammars/autohotkey.cson` with the versions in this repo.  An Atom repository is currently in the works.

## Features

  * Built-in variables
  * Commands
  * Directives
  * Quoted string literals
  * Line & block comments
  * Numeric literals
  * Operators
