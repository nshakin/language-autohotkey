Props to Dayle Rees and his beautifully designed *Revalation* theme: [daylerees/colour-schemes](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes "daylerees/colour-schemes") 


## Features
Syntax highlighting support for the following match types:
* Quoted strings
* Percent sign enclosed strings
* Comment lines
* Numbers
* Directives
* Built-in system variables
* Named key constants
* Function declarations
* Commonly used hotkey modifiers and symbols () English

## Planned Features
These are features that I soon hope to implement and/or improve upon in future updates:
* Snippets for all system variables and functions
* General improvements to the regular expression formulas used for syntax matching
* Code folding support
* File system commands for reloading/pausing/compiling AHK scripts.

## About
I'm not entirely sure why I find AutoHotKey to be so extremely satisfying but you can understand my frustration at having a lack of support for my favorite new text editor.  So I figured, why not make it myself!  So I learned some stuff about Atom, improved my RegEx skills and created my first project that can actually be used by everyone.  

This is my first real experience in building a plugin for an application and I'm really excited to be making this available to others who can benefit from it as I do.

Thank you to everyone who installs and enjoys using this package.  Hope you love it!!!
